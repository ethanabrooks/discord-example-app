It is also known by its indigenous name, Tahoma or Tacoma, which means \"mother of waters\" or \"snow-covered mountain\" in the language of the Puyallup tribe.\n\nMount Rainier is part of the Mount Rainier National Park, which was established in 1899 and covers an area of 369 square miles (956 square kilometers). The park is renowned for its diverse ecosystems, including old-growth forests, subalpine meadows, and glaciers.\n\nThe mountain is surrounded by several rivers, including the Nisqually, Carbon, and White rivers, which originate from the melting glaciers on its slopes. These rivers provide important water sources for the region and support a variety of wildlife, including elk, black bears, and mountain goats.\n\nMount Rainier is also known for its extensive glaciers, which cover approximately 35 square miles (91 square kilometers) of its surface. The largest of these glaciers is the Emmons Glacier, which stretches for over four miles (6.4 kilometers) and is the largest glacier in the contiguous United States.\n\nThe mountain attracts thousands of climbers and hikers each year, with several routes leading to its summit.

Elk - wildlife in the national park\n8. Mountain goats - wildlife in the national park\n9. Marmots - wildlife in the national park\n10. Wonderland Trail - a hiking trail (length: 93 miles / 150 kilometers)\n11. Disappointment Cleaver - a climbing route to the summit of Mount Rainier\n\nPhysical relationships:\n1. Mount Rainier is located within Mount Rainier National Park.\n2. The old-growth forests and subalpine meadows are within the national park.\n3. The glaciers cover the mountain.\n4. The Wonderland Trail encircles Mount Rainier.\n5. The Disappointment Cleaver is a climbing route on Mount Rainier.\n\nPlausible xy coordinates:\nSince the size and exact layout of Mount Rainier and its surroundings are not specified, it is difficult to provide precise xy coordinates. However, we can assume that Mount Rainier is located at the center of the national park, with the old-growth forests and subalpine meadows surrounding it. The glaciers would cover the upper parts of the mountain. The Wonderland Trail would encircle the mountain, possibly at a lower elevation. The Disappointment Cleaver route would start from a base camp or a specific point on the mountain."},{"role":"user","content":"\n5.
