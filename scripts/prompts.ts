export default `We are making a video game in which the player solves a murder mystery. One hallmark of a great mystery is a clue or set of clues that appear to point to one conclusion but later revelations force us to reinterpret them. The first thing we want to do is brainstorm some clues like this.

At the beginning of Knives Out (Rian Johnson), a maid discovers millionaire Harlan Thrombey with his throat slit in his study, the night of his birthday party when all of his children and grandchildren are in attendance. The blood spatter patterns appear to confirm that the wound was self-inflicted, a clue pointing irrefutably toward suicide. Another clue is the account of several relatives that Marta, Harlan’s beloved caretaker, was seen leaving that evening, and shortly thereafter, Harlan was seen descending the only staircase to his room, which creaks loudly. These clues seem to point unambiguously to a suicide. But there are other clues that suggest that some scheme is afoot. First, someone has hired the famed investigator Benoit Blanc without revealing their identity, a mystery in its own right. Second, as Benoit points out, the manner of death is unusual for a suicide. Third, Harlan appears to have cut off all of his relatives the night of the party, providing them with a motive for murder. Eventually, Marta reveals the truth about her last night with Harlan. After their traditional evening game of go, Marta realized that she had accidentally switched his medications, administering a lethal dose of morphine. With minutes to live, Harlan planned a series of events that would provide Marta an irrefutable alibi. Per Harlan’s plan, Marta left the house, observed by the relatives, before his death, then Harlan slit his own throat. After leaving, Martathen snuck back using a secret entrance, disguised herself as Harlan, then came down the stairs to ensure that he was observed alive after she left. This part of the plan went smoothly but while sneaking back out, Marta was spotted by Harlan’s aging mother, Nana, who mistook her for Ransom, Harlan’s grandson and the family pariah. Thus Harlan’s death was no ordinary suicide but a carefully orchestrated scheme designed to free Marta from suspicion. Note that none of the clues are discarded as red herrings. The suicide was real, but is given a new and surprising motive. Meanwhile some clues remain unexplained – the anonymous hiring of Benoit Blanc. Also, during the exposition of these events, we receive another subtle clue: When Nana sees Marta sneaking out, she asks, “Ransom, back so soon?” This seemingly innocuous incident – an apparent joke about Nana’s confusion and Marta’s luck at not being recognized – will prove significant later in the film. During a subsequent conversation between Marta and Ransom, we receive another disguised clue. He bitterly muses to Marta that during his final conversation with Harlan, Harlan had told him that he was not the only person who could beat him at go: Marta could as well. As the movie continues, we discover that Harlan has chosen to leave his entire inheritance to Marta. The relatives are aghast but they figure out that they can reverse the will if it turns out that Marta was responsible for Harlan’s death. For Benoit, this is the final piece to the puzzle. He realizes that this explains his anonymous hiring: a member of the family knew about the inheritance before Harlan’s death and decided to set up Marta as his killer so that the will would be reversed. The hope was that Benoit would discover Marta’s guilt, but not the larger plot to set her up. Benoit reflects on Ransom’s comment about Marta beating Harlan at go and wonders how Marta could have arisen in the conversation. He realizes that Harlan must have told Ransom about the will in their final conversation. He also interviews Nana about what she saw that night (until then, she had been dismissed as a senile crone). She reveals that she saw Ransom entering the house using the secret passage (hence her mistaking Marta for a returning Ransom). Benoit figures out that Ransom had in fact snuck in and switched the medication labels so that Marta would administer the wrong amounts. It turns out that Marta had chosen the medication using weight and feel, not the label, since she had administered the dose so many times in the past. Marta had not mixed up the medications, but only thought she had, having read the label after administering the dose. Ransom is arrested and Marta is awarded her justly deserved inheritance. 

Reflecting on this plot and Benoit’s detective work, we note a few things. First, the setup intrigues the viewer, with many hints that there is more than meets the eye to this seemingly ordinary event of an old man’s suicide. In an early conversation with the police investigators, Benoit muses about all of the irregularities in the case – the strange method of suicide, the conflict with the relatives, and above all the mystery of his anonymous client. Also, note that none of the early clues are left hanging. All are explained, and eventually reinterpreted to indicate the true story and the guilty party. In particular, note the subtle early clues that point to the final revelation – Nana mistaking Marta for Ransom and Ransom revealing that Marta had come up in his final conversation with Harlan. Also, note the twist within a twist: the initial twist of Harlan killing himself to protect Marta’s innocence and the subsequent twist, that Ransom had tampered with the medications. Finally, note that the revealed truth is more scintillating than the initial suicide misdirection, a complex web of deceit and familial betrayal, touching on topical themes of greed and entitlement.

Another great example of detective work is The Poet (Michael Connelly), in which reporter Jack Mcevoy learns that his brother Sean, a cop, committed suicide. He is found in a park, a gunshot wound to the head, and what seems like a suicide note drawn on the fogged up windshield. This fogged up windshield will turn out to be a clue. Initially, the novel dwells on Jack’s relationship to his brother and his family without calling the suicide narrative into question. On the way to informing Sean’s wife, Jack is overcome with nausea and Sean’s partner, who is driving, barely turns off the safety locks in time for Jack to get out before vomiting. We learn that Sean and his partner had cultivated the habit of always keeping the safety locks on to avoid any slip-ups with prisoners. Again, this is a disguised clue. Eventually, Jack starts to identify ways that his brother’s suicide could have been staged by a killer. He notes that windows fog up when people talk inside a car, suggesting that his brother was not alone at the time of his death. Returning to the scene of his brother’s death, he realizes that while there wasn’t time for a killer to flee the car after the shot and before the ranger came to check out the scene, he could have hid in the back and then left after the ranger turned back to call in the incident. Last, recalling the earlier account about the safety locks, he reexamines the vehicle and discovers that the safety locks were off, strongly suggesting that someone had turned them off in order to get out after the murder. Thinking about this setup, note all the ways that it provides Jack (and the reader) an opportunity for great detective work. Again, note the ways that clues which initially seemed innocuous: the fogged up window merely providing a method for Sean to write his suicide note; the safety locks introduced incidentally in a scene whose primary role appears to be emphasizing Jack’s distress. Finally, we note that murder is usually a more intriguing narrative device than suicide, unless (as in the case of Knives Out) the suicide has a really compelling explanation. 

Taking inspiration from these examples, here are some interesting mechanisms by which a clever detective can uncover the truth:

Fabricated Alibi: The player finds out that a character has an alibi that appears to be rock-solid at first. However, after investigating further and cross-referencing with other details, the protagonist uncovers that the alibi is fake. For example, a timestamp on a surveillance video does not align with the witness' claims. The protagonist could use technology to examine the metadata of the video, revealing that it was tampered with.

Subtle Clue in Casual Conversation: The protagonist has regular dialogues with the characters throughout the game. At one point, a character mentions something offhand that later turns out to be a major clue. This could be uncovered by the protagonist through his ability to remember and connect insignificant conversations with new pieces of information, sparking a revelation.

Hidden Relationship: The protagonist uncovers a secret relationship between two characters that changes the course of the investigation. They might do this by examining call logs, emails, or personal belongings of a character, and find messages or items suggesting an undisclosed relationship.

Hidden Motive: A character might appear to have no reason to commit the murder, but upon closer inspection of their personal and professional life, the protagonist uncovers a hidden motive. This could be discovered through finding hidden documents, or overhearing a revealing conversation.

Inconsistent Behaviors: The protagonist observes that a character's actions do not align with their personality or typical behavior patterns. This inconsistency could be spotted through psychological profiling, observing contradictions in characters' behaviours over time, or sudden changes in their routine.

1. Use some of these ideas to come up with a few clues, which initially seem to point to one set of events but which are revealed to have another interpretation after some keen sleuthing.
2. Develop a coherent scenario from the clues.`;
