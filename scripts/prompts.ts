Scenario:
In the small town of Riverton, renowned jeweler Mr. Harold Sterling has been robbed of his prized collection of rare and valuable jewels. The police have arrested Ms. Olivia Thompson, a skilled jewel thief with a history of similar crimes, as the primary suspect. However, there is a plausible alternative culprit who could have committed the crime. Let's explore the details of this intriguing mock trial scenario.

Characters:
1. Mr. Harold Sterling - The victim and owner of the stolen jewels.
2. Ms. Olivia Thompson - The primary suspect, a skilled jewel thief.
3. Detective Robert Johnson - The lead investigator on the case.
4. Ms. Victoria Morgan - A close friend of Mr. Sterling and a rival jeweler.
5. Mr. Benjamin Carter - A disgruntled former employee of Mr. Sterling.
6. Judge Emily Davis - The presiding judge.
7. Defense Attorney - Represents Ms. Olivia Thompson.
8. Prosecuting Attorney - Represents the State.

Key Facts:

2. The stolen jewels were valued at over $1 million.
3. Ms. Thompson was seen near the crime scene shortly before the robbery.
4. Detective Johnson found a set of gloves with Ms. Thompson's fingerprints at the scene.
5. Ms. Thompson claims she was framed and has an alibi for the time of the crime.

Alternative Culprit:
Mr. Benjamin Carter, a disgruntled former employee of Mr. Sterling, had recently been fired due to financial discrepancies in the company's books. He had access to the residence and knowledge of the valuable jewels.

Defense Argument:

1. Mr. Carter's access to the residence and knowledge of the valuable jewels.
2. Testimonies from other employees regarding Mr. Carter's disgruntled behavior after his termination.
3. Fingerprints on a separate set of gloves found at the crime scene, which do not match Ms. Thompson's.

Prosecution Argument:
The prosecuting attorney argues that Ms. Thompson's presence near the crime scene, her history as a jewel thief, and the gloves with her fingerprints are strong evidence against her. They present the following evidence:
1. Surveillance footage showing Ms. Thompson near the crime scene.
2. Ms. Thompson's previous convictions for similar crimes.
3. Expert testimony linking the gloves found at the scene to Ms. Thompson.

Witnesses:
1. Detective Robert Johnson - Testifies about the evidence found at the crime scene.
